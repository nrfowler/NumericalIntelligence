Many pre-employment screening tests are starting to just be like "hey, try to do mental math as fast as possible." This game aims to train people, namely just me, to do well on those tests.
## Game Modes
### Multiplication
Starts at 2 digit then increases
### Serial Addition
Simulates adding items on a receipt.
### Long Addition
Starts at 5 digit, then goes up to 8 digit.
### Bridge Point Count
A favorite of many engineers. Find the high point count plus the length points.
## Blink mode
Blink mode simulates cases where you are verbally told a number but cannot see it.
## Scoring
 It is designed to be done during 5 minute work breaks by having each question scored based on correctness and time elapsed and then adding the score to a running total. The "average" score shown is the best estimate for your score based on that mode. Each level increases either the digits (multiply or long add) or the number of addends (serial addition).
## Planned Features
* TODO: Flashing bridge game (and all p questions), bidding game (1NT), and trick points game
* TODO: Progress bar, time limit
* TODO: If wrong, show question for 5 seconds
## Changelog
* adding one for holding four aces.
* Goren[5] and others[7] recommend deducting one HCP for a singleton king, queen, or jack.
### Alphanumeric Arithmetic [deactivated]
Simulates variables. Gives a better grasp of the alphabet so that whenever you have to sort something alphabetically it is easier.
### Penalty mode
Penalty Mode decrements points when the wrong answer is entered. No Penalty Mode does not.
